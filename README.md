# Incident Response Life Cycle
The Incident Response Life Cycle is a four phase process which promotes continual improvement within an organization to better defend and handle cyber attacks. A constant feedback loop that allows defenders to reflect on previous cyber attacks and understand what went wrong, what they did well, and how to better improve their response plan and security infastructure.

## Preparation
An organization's capability to respond to and prevent incidents by implementing proper security systems and setting up documented processes to streamline response and recovery. To properly prepare for an incident, organizations need to take inventory of all critical assets and how they could be impacted during an attack. Performing a risk assessment will inform security teams of vulnerabilities and help to identify the most critical aspects of an organization's business operations. Using this information, teams can prioritize specific hardware and software tools that align with an organization's most critical needs. It's important to outline primary and backup communication channels to ensure communication for incident handlers and important stakeholders. The preparation phase, at its core, works to prevent cyberattacks by promoting the need to understand where risks and vulnerabilities lie and implementing measures to protect them.
